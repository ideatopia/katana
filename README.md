# Katana

A lightweight web server written in Rust, designed for serving static content with *`elegance`*.

> **Note:** This project started as a learning initiative but is being developed with "production-grade" standards in mind. While it's currently in development, we're working towards making it "production-ready". Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve its reliability and feature set.

## Features
