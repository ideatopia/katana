# Katana

A lightweight web server written in Rust, designed for serving static content with *`elegance`*.

> **Note:** This project started as a learning initiative but is being developed with "production-grade" standards in mind. While it's currently in development, we're working towards making it "production-ready". Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve its reliability and feature set.

## Features

- Static file serving with directory listing
- Chunked file transfer for large files
- Range request support
- Configurable host, port, and root directory
- Multi-worker support
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Quick Start
